<center><b><font size=+1>SIMPL Runtime Support</font></b>
<p><i>James Gil de Lamadrid</i></center>

<p>This section describes <a href="#c">code conventions</a> used by the
SIMPL compiler, and the parts of the <a href="#j">JVM architecture</a>
that are pertinent to SIMPL.
<p><a NAME="c"></a><b>Runtime Convention</b>
<p>All expressions in SIMPL are evaluated in a uniform way. An expression
is an operator with several operands, which are themselves expressions.
By convention, to evaluate an operator, its operands are first evaluated.
As each operand is evaluated it pushes its result on to the system stack.
Then, the operator pops the operator pops the operand values off of the
stack, processes them, and pushes its result onto the stack. In this way
no temporary variables are required. All temporary storage is allocated
off of the stack.
<p>SIMPL programs are compiled to a <i>jasmin</i> method (procedure). The
<i>Java</i>
conventions for function calls are followed. That is to say, arguments
are pushed onto the stack, and values are returned on the stack. On the
JVM, each method has its own stack, and its own local variables. The <i>jasmin</i>
assembler must be informed as to the number of local variables each method
is using, and the size of its stack. Local variables are identified by
their numbers. All SIMPL variables are stored in local variables. The compiler,
therefore, generates labels for use with gotos, and numbers to be used
as variables.
<p>If a SIMPL program declares <i>n</i> variables (including IN, OUT, and
LOCAL variables), the corresponding <i>jasmin</i> method should allocate
<i>n</i>
+ 1 local variables. Local variable 0 is special purpose, and should not
be used by the method. Local variables 1 through <i>n</i> are used to implement
the SIMPL variables. A method's stack size is set to one more than the
number of leaf nodes (including variable declarations) in the syntax tree.
It can be shown that this size exceeds the maximum number of items a SIMPL
program can push.
<p><a NAME="j"></a><b><i>Jasmin</i> and the JVM</b>
<p>A JVM executable program consists of one or more <i>.class</i> files.
Each class file is roughly equivalent to an object file. On the JVM linking
is dynamic. This means that if a method is called which is external to
the <i>.class</i> file, the method is located during runtime. This eliminates
the need for a linker, which performs static linking. To narrow down the
search required for the dynamic link, the environment variable, CLASSPATH,
contains the paths to all library directives, and only these libraries
are searched during dynamic linking.
<p>The JVM is a stack based machine. All instructions use the current method's
stack to perform operations.
<p>Below is a list of the <i>jasmin</i> directives and JVM instructions
used in the <a href="codegen.html">code templates</a>.
